# E-mail-marketing
This tool use to automate the mails
This code will read a CSV file containing a list of email addresses and names, and send an email to each recipient. The CSV file should have one recipient per row, with the email address in the first column and the name in the second column.

Note that this code uses the SMTP server of Gmail to send the emails, so you will need to use a Gmail account and provide your email address and password in the login function. If you want to use a different email provider, you will need to use a different SMTP server and potentially different login credentials.
